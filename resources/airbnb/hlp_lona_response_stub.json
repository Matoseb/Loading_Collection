                        "answer": "Airbnb’s Smart Pricing tool lets you set your prices to automatically go up or down based on changes in demand for listings like yours.\n\nYou’re always responsible for your price, so Smart Pricing is controlled by other pricing settings you choose, and you can adjust nightly prices any time.\n\nSmart Pricing is based on the type and location of your listing, the season, demand, and other factors (like events in your area)."

                        "answer": "Airbnb typically releases your payout about 24 hours after your guest’s scheduled check-in time. The time it takes for the funds to arrive in your account depends on the method you choose to get paid.\n\nIf your guest is staying for 28 or more nights, Airbnb typically releases the payout for the first month about 24 hours after your guest’s scheduled check-in time. Additional payouts for that reservation are released monthly.\n\nIf you’re a new host, we may hold your payouts for 30 days after your first reservation is confirmed. If your first reservation is more than 30 days away, your payout will be released 24 hours after your guest’s scheduled check-in. This will apply to any payouts scheduled to be released during those 30 days."

                        "answer": "The price you charge for your listing is completely up to you. To help you decide, you can search for comparable listings in your city or neighborhood to get an idea of market prices.\n\nAdditional Fees\n- Cleaning fee: You can either incorporate a cleaning fee into your nightly price or you can add a cleaning fee in your pricing settings.\n\n- Other fees: To charge extra fees outside of your rates (like a late check-in or pet fee), you must first disclose these potential charges to guests prior to booking and then use our Resolution Center to securely request payment for additional fees."

                        "question": "How do taxes work for hosts?",
                        "answer": "You’ll want to check with your local government about whether or not taxes needs to be collected from guests. If you determine that you need to collect a tax, you can usually either add it within a Special Offer when guests book or ask your guests to pay it in person. In each case, it’s important that guests are informed of the exact tax amount prior to booking. If you choose to collect tax outside of your listing’s rates, it should be collected only upon arrival. We aren’t able to assist with or ensure collection.\n\nIn some locations, Airbnb hosts may have a collect and remit feature available to handle occupancy tax. Hosts should not collect occupancy taxes separately for those jurisdictions.\n\nAlso, in some locations, Value Added Tax (VAT) may apply.
